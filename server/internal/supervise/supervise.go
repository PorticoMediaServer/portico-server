// Package supervise contains the process's panic containment.
//
// net/http recovers a panic raised inside a handler, so HTTP handlers were never
// the process-kill vector. Every other goroutine was: one panic in a search
// fan-out, an HLS producer, a scanner batch or any of the twenty long-lived
// supervisor loops took the whole server down, and "the server restarted and I
// don't know why" is the worst failure a home appliance can have.
//
// Nothing here changes behaviour on the success path. A goroutine that does not
// panic runs exactly as it did. A goroutine that does is logged with its stack,
// counted so the owner's diagnostics can show it, and — for a stateless
// long-lived loop — restarted with backoff.
//
// The division is deliberate. Go recovers and ends that goroutine: right for
// per-request fan-out and fire-and-forget work, where the request fails and
// nothing else is affected. Supervise restarts: right for a loop whose state
// lives in the database rather than in the goroutine, where not running at all
// is the worse outcome. A loop holding in-memory state it would resume with half
// built is not a candidate for either, and is left to fail loudly.
