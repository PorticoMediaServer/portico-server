// A background loop that polls is really asking one question: has anything
// changed? The database knows the answer exactly, because every change in this
// server goes through one write gate. So instead of fifteen loops asking four
// times a second, every committed write tells them once.
//
// That is what makes an idle server genuinely idle: no writes, no wakes, no
// queries. And it is what keeps a busy server responsive, because a loop hears
// about work the moment it is enqueued rather than up to a tick later — which is
// better than the timers it replaces, not merely cheaper.
//
// It is deliberately coarse. A loop woken by a commit that had nothing to do
// with it asks one question and goes back to sleep; on a server where writes are
// happening at all, one extra query is not the cost worth optimising.

// changingCommits counts transactions that actually changed rows. It is the
// honest "did anything happen?" signal a background loop needs: the write gate's
// acquisition count moves for a transaction that wrote nothing, which is exactly
// the shape a "nothing to do" pass has, so a loop that watched acquisitions
// would see itself and never settle.
