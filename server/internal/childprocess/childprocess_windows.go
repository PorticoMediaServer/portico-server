// Windows has no process groups in the Unix sense and does not propagate
// termination, so the mechanism is a Job Object with
// JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE: when the last handle to the job closes —
// which happens when this process dies, however it dies — every process in the
// job is terminated.
//
// The job is assigned to the SERVER process rather than to each child, because a
// child created by a process already in a job joins that job automatically. One
// call at startup therefore covers every child, every grandchild, every helper's
// rclone and every sandbox wrapper, with no per-call-site bookkeeping to forget.
//
// UNVERIFIED: this cannot be exercised on the machine it was written on. It is
// compile-checked for windows/amd64 and windows/arm64 and it fails soft — a
// server that cannot create or join a job runs exactly as it did before.
