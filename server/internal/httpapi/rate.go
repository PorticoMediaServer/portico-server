// The sign-in limiter is the one piece of admission that a single client could
// turn into a refusal for everybody else. Its table was bounded at 1,024 entries
// and, once full of entries that were not yet stale, it answered `false` — which
// is to say: it stopped every sign-in on the server, for everyone, until the
// minute rolled over. A client that can make the server refuse other clients is
// the thing this whole workstream exists to prevent, and a limiter is a
// particularly bad place for it, because the flood that fills the table is
// exactly the situation in which honest people are trying to sign in.
//
// So the table is never a reason to refuse. It is bounded by eviction — stale
// windows first, then the least recently seen entry — and the limit itself is
// counted at two breadths:
//
//   - the exact client address, at the same twenty attempts a minute it has
//     always been, so nothing a real client does changes;
//   - the client's network, far more generously, so that an attacker who has a
//     /64 of IPv6 addresses (which is every IPv6 customer) cannot evade the
//     first count simply by using a new address for every attempt.
//
// The network ceiling is deliberately sixty-four times the per-address one. Two
// hundred people behind one home router signing in after a restart is about two
// hundred attempts a minute between them; a rotation flood is thousands. The gap
// is wide enough that the first is never touched and narrow enough that the
// second is stopped.
