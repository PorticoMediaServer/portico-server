// net/http derives every request's context from its connection's, and cancels
// the connection's context whenever its background read of the socket fails —
// including a read deadline that a handler set and let expire. The socket stays
// usable, so the client keeps the keep-alive connection and every later request
// on it arrives with a context that is already canceled: anything that checks
// its context fails at once, for as long as the client keeps that connection.
//
// A request whose context is canceled before any handler has run is on such a
// connection (or its client has just gone, in which case nothing here matters).
// It is served with the cancellation detached — the lane budgets still bound
// it — and the connection is closed after the reply, so the client's next
// request opens a fresh one. HTTP/2 streams are left alone: there a canceled
// context means the stream itself was reset.
