// Admission decides how much work the server will carry. It does not decide who
// gets to do it, and until now nothing did: a lane was a race, and the client
// that asked most often won most often. That is the whole of "one client can
// hurt another" — a phone stuck in a reconnect loop, a script paging a library
// as fast as the server answers, or a device on a bad link retrying every
// request, can hold most of a lane and leave everyone else queueing behind it.
// None of them is malicious and none of them is stopped by a capacity number.
//
// So each lane keeps a ledger of how many slots each client holds, and a client
// may not exceed its share of the lane. Two properties make this invisible to
// people using the server normally:
//
//   - It engages only when the lane is actually contended AND more than one
//     client is in it. A lone viewer may hold the entire lane however busy it
//     makes it, which is what keeps a quiet server as fast as it has ever been.
//   - The share is far above what any real client asks for. A browsing share is
//     six requests in flight at once from one device; an app issues two or three
//     while a page loads.
//
// A request over its share is not refused while the lane has room for it. It
// waits on the lane's own queue, for the lane's own queue-wait, and is then
// refused with exactly the 503 and Retry-After that a full lane already answers
// — a shape every client already handles.
