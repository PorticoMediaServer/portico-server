// The server sets no WriteTimeout on purpose: a stream and a byte range
// legitimately outlive any fixed budget, and a global one would cut off a
// healthy download. The consequence, until now, was that nothing bounded a
// single write. Once a client stops reading and the socket buffer fills,
// fmt.Fprintf on an event stream blocks indefinitely — no RST arrives from a
// phone that went into a tunnel, sometimes for many minutes. The goroutine, its
// lane slot, its open file and, for a mounted source, its helper process are all
// held for that whole time. The bounded stream-lifetime timer never fires,
// because the goroutine is stuck inside the write rather than in its select.
//
// Two shapes, for the two kinds of write:
//
//   - A frame deadline for server-sent events. Each frame is small and a
//     legitimate client accepts one in milliseconds, so twenty seconds — the
//     heartbeat interval — is invisible when healthy and reclaims a dead socket
//     within one beat.
//   - A rolling deadline for media bodies, refreshed on every successful write.
//     This is the one that has to be right: a fixed deadline would cut off a
//     slow-but-alive client part way through a long file, which is exactly the
//     client least able to recover. What is bounded is the gap between two
//     successful writes, not the length of the response.

// These are variables rather than constants so a test can shrink them; nothing
// in the server writes to them.
