// A home document is seventeen rows of up to sixty entries, each carrying an
// overview truncated to a thousand runes — three hundred kilobytes of JSON that
// gzips to about forty. At two hundred viewers that difference is socket time
// and buffer memory on a machine that has neither to spare, and on the bad
// networks this server is expected to serve over it is the difference between a
// page arriving and a page timing out.
//
// Three kinds of response are deliberately left alone:
//
//   - Media bodies and bulk transfers. They are already compressed bytes, so
//     gzip spends CPU to make them very slightly larger, and they are served
//     with byte ranges that a compressed stream cannot express.
//   - Server-sent events. Compressing a stream means buffering it, and an event
//     stream that is buffered is no longer an event stream.
//   - Anything already carrying a Content-Encoding.
//
// The middleware also refuses to compress a response it cannot see the type of
// yet, and it never compresses a 304 — which has no body by definition and whose
// headers must not describe one.

// compressibleLanes are the lanes whose responses are JSON documents. Deciding
// by lane rather than by path keeps this in step with the admission table: a
// route that is classified as a media body is one, whatever it is called.
