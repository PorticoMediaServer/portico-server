// Two caches in this package were the shape the old server had already learned
// not to use, and both cost more the busier the server got.
//
// The count cache was a 128-entry slice scanned linearly under a mutex on every
// home row. At seventeen rows and two hundred viewers that is a hot lock held
// for a scan, to avoid a query that takes a millisecond.
//
// The facet cache had no single-flight and evicted by throwing itself away: at
// 512 entries it emptied, so a busy server with more than 512 live keys kept
// discarding the work it had just done, and a cold key was computed once per
// concurrent viewer rather than once. The old server's rule (audit principle 21)
// is the one applied here: every cache is bounded in entries and in time, and is
// paired with a single-flight map.

// countKey identifies an exact count for one library, profile, revision and
// mode. It is a comparable struct, so it is a map key.
