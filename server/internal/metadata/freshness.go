// Two things decided how often this server asked a metadata provider for a document it
// already had: nothing, and nothing. A work row woken for any reason called the provider, and
// nothing anywhere bounded how many such calls a library could make. On a two or three million
// item library behind a one-a-second pacing clock that is a month of continuous requests to
// one service, per pass, which is not an allowance anybody grants.
//
// So there are three rules, and they are all here.
//
//  1. Freshness. A fetched document is trusted for a period that depends on what it is. A
//     finished film's facts do not change; a series that is airing this week gains an episode
//     every week; a fingerprint-to-recording mapping barely moves at all. Inside that period a
//     refresh is not considered, and the stored evidence is republished instead — so local
//     changes still reach the catalogue while the provider is not asked.
//  2. Conditional requests. Outside that period the provider is asked, but with the validators
//     it gave last time, so an unchanged document is a 304 with no body.
//  3. A budget. Refreshes are bounded per provider per hour and per day, durably, so a
//     restart cannot reset the allowance and a library-wide wake cannot spend it in one pass.
//     A first fetch is never budgeted: a newly added item is what the person is waiting for.

// Freshness windows, per provider and resource kind. They are deliberately generous. A
// provider is a source of facts that were mostly settled before the file existed; the cost of
// being a week late with a changed overview is nothing, and the cost of asking is a request
// that a library of millions multiplies by millions.
