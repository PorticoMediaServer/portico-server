// The host-disconnect timeline is wall-clock: a host who stops sending
// heartbeats has to become "reconnecting", then paused, then ended, whether or
// not anybody asks. Something must therefore advance it on a clock.
//
// That something used to be every open event stream. Each stream ticked every
// five seconds and called Sweep, and Sweep opened a gated write transaction for
// every live group and rolled it back when — as almost always — nothing had
// changed. Six people watching together meant six streams, so six transactions
// through the server's single writer every five seconds, for a group sitting
// paused. The cost was proportional to how many people were watching, which is
// exactly backwards: the timeline is a property of the group, not of how many
// people are looking at it.
//
// So there is one sweeper for the process, running while any live group exists
// (state not ended/failed), whether or not a stream is open, and Sweep now
// decides what is due with a read and writes only for the groups that actually
// need it. A server where nothing has timed out pays one query every five
// seconds, no matter how many people are watching, and a server with no live
// group runs no loop and no query.

// SweepInterval is how often the host timeline advances. It is the resolution of
// the reconnect grace period, not a polling interval: nothing is discovered by
// sweeping more often, because the thresholds are tens of seconds.
