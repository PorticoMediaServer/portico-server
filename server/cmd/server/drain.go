// Shutdown was a LIFO chain of defers and several of them blocked forever:
// `cancel(); <-scanDone; <-retentionDone`, `stopSetup(); <-setupDone`, the
// certificate, network and discovery joins. If the scanner was inside a blocked
// ffprobe or a hung network mount, SIGTERM produced a process that never exited;
// systemd then escalated to SIGKILL on its own timeout, at which point the
// generated-media cleanup, the write-ahead-log checkpoint and db.Close never ran
// at all. A shutdown that hangs is a shutdown that corrupts nothing and cleans
// nothing — the worst of both.
//
// One barrier instead. Every long-lived loop registers a name, how to stop it
// and a channel that closes when it has. Shutdown stops them all, waits for all
// of them under a single budget, and says by name which ones did not finish —
// and then proceeds, because proceeding is what lets the checkpoint and the
// close happen.
//
// The recording drain is deliberately not part of this and keeps its own
// fifteen seconds: it protects capture that cannot be recovered, and it is the
// one thing worth waiting for on its own terms.

// drainBudget is how long every registered loop has, together.
